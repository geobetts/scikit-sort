Algorithms to predict using sorting

Consistent with scikit-learn API.

This is a potential solution to prediction problems with multi-class categorical features with many classes. In scikit-learn, these can be difficult to deal with (e.g. one-hot encoding creates a very large dataset). The algorithm in this library are intended to be simple, usable with little pre-processing and fast.
